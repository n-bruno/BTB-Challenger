# BTB-Challenger
This project no longer works as the BTB challenger website is down.

I coded the project in Golang and JavaScript. In hindsight, I should've used a frontend framework like React. This was also my first Golang program, and I've learned a lot since. For example, I should have used the "flags" package to handle commandline arguments. Additionally, I should have coded better handling and had the errors logged and handled properly. But that's just scratching the surface.
